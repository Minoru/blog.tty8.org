My name is Alexander Batischev. I got my Master's of CS in 2015, and now I'm
working as a software developer. In my spare time, I maintain
[Newsboat][newsboat], bang my head to some heavy metal riffs, read books, and
<strike>cycle</strike> dream about getting back to cycling.

This blog used to be a place to share my experiences with Linux, but over the
years, it expanded to other topics, ranging from software licenses and ICFP
programming contest to nice hardware and life lessons. It still retains its
original name, Debiania, unimaginatively derived from the first distro
I actually used. It moved a couple times: from debiania.blogspot.com to
blog.debiania.in.ua and then to blog.tty8.org.

If you're interested in how this site gets put together, take a look at [the
source code][debiania-src].

I'm always happy to receive some personal email; [shoot me a message][email]!
Encrypting it to [PGP key 0x356961a20c8bfd03][pgp] would be a nice touch. (I
also have [an old key, 0x0a1d7d827b52fb07][pgp-old]; don't use it. Can't revoke
it because I lost the certificate).

To make life a bit easier for Daniel Graystone (and, undoubtedly, for the Big
Brother as well), here's a list of other corners of the Internet where one can
find me self-expressing:

* [GitHub][github], [GitLab][gitlab], [Codeberg][codeberg]
* <a rel="me" href="https://functional.cafe/@minoru">Fediverse</a>
* [irc.libera.chat][libera] and [OFTC][oftc], where I hang out as Minoru; used
  to visit Freenode too, but not anymore. I'm using a bouncer, so I appear
  online even if I'm not actually at the computer. I'm also using OTR, so if
  you want a *really* private conversation, ask me to get back to you
* and last but not least, StackExchange network:
