<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>ICFP contest participants retain ownership of all intellectual property
rights in and to any submitted solutions, custom tools, and related
materials ("Submissions") that participants had before submission. As a
condition of entry, participants grant Galois, Inc. a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use,
reproduce, publish, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the
Submissions for the purposes of allowing Galois, Inc. and other ICFP
judges to test and evaluate the Submissions for purposes of the contest.</p>

<h2>Tidbits and Clarifications</h2>

<ul>

  <li>(2015-08-10 12:15 UTC) The qualification round has ended, and the
  final qualification scoreboard has been posted. There were nearly 1.25
  million solutions submitted by over 300 teams, with nearly 800
  participants overall. Further information about the final round, the
  contest organization/infrastructure, and the fate of the universe will
  be forthcoming over the weeks leading to the announcement of the
  winners at ICFP 2015. Thanks to all recruits for your participation,
  enthusiasm, and dedication!</li>
   
  <li>(2015-08-10 07:45 UTC) <em>ALERT</em>: At this point, over 1.15
  million solutions have been submitted by over 300 teams. Our
  preliminary analysis of the discovered davar indicates that Stross was
  mistaken; they will delay the inevitable
  &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
  scenario by 63 months.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-09 11:00 UTC) <em>ALERT</em>: A bug that caused the
  leaderboard to sometimes report unexpectedly high
  scores&mdash;possibly related to including two solutions for a
  single problem and seed in a single submission&mdash;has been
  fixed. Rankings have been adjusted.</li>

  <li>(2015-08-09 11:00 UTC) The formless spawn have transformed one
  of the undiscovered words of power, reshaping it in the image of
  their master!</li>

  <li>(2015-08-08 23:00 UTC) A sample command sequence for problem 6,
  seed 0 can be found
  in <a href="icfpc-2015-problem6-seed0.txt">problem6-seed0.txt</a>. This
  sequence has 1,180 commands (which is why we have not posted it
  directly on this page). It results in a score of 3,261, does not
  cause an error, and does not contain any phrases of
  power.  <a href="https://vimeo.com/135767536">Video</a> for this
  command sequence is available as well.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-08 22:05 UTC) <em>ALERT</em>: It has come to our
  attention that participants have submitted many solutions using seeds
  that were not provided by AS2H2. Unfortunately, this has caused
  elements of the scoring system evaluating those solutions to be
  swallowed by the gibbering darkness. We are taking actions to mitigate
  this issue by filtering out such unsafe solutions. We hope to have the
  leaderboard back online soon. In the meantime, be aware that
  repeatedly submitting solutions with unapproved seeds may lead to...
  consequences. For you, and anyone within a 10-mile radius.</li>
  
  <li> (2015-08-08 21:30 UTC) <em>ALERT</em>: The leaderboard is down
  temporarily as we make adjustments to improve the performance of
  evaluation of submissions.  We are nearing 300 teams and 200K
  submissions.</li>
  
  <li> (2015-08-08 17:45 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: Power
  phrases must be pronounced precisely, and in their original
  tongue---not in isomorphism thereof.  Agents may notice subtle
  shifts in their mana.</li>
  
  <li id="deep">(2015-08-08 12:00 UTC) <em>ALERT</em>: It has come to
  the attention of
  &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;
  that there is considerable risk of an unintentional summoning event in
  Vancouver in early September. Because Vancouver borders their domain,
  they have invoked the Benthic treaty and demanded extra precautions.
  Thus, we have added <a href="icfpc-2015-problems.html">problem 24</a> to the
  set.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 23:30 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: Sequences of commands 
  that do not result in one of the three game-ending conditions described in the 
  specification are allowed. They are scored in exactly the same way as other
  sequences.</li>
   
  <li>(2015-08-07 23:00 UTC) A sample play for board 6, seed 0 is
  rendered at the <a href="https://vimeo.com/135714988">Galois Vimeo
  channel</a>.<br/>  (2015-08-08 17:00 UTC) Note that, due to bug
  fixes in the evaluation server, the command sequence earlier
  provided is no longer valid for this animation.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 21:00 UTC) The unpredictability of the eldritch
  forces involved makes it impossible for us to provide precise
  information on time and memory resource availability during the time
  of final judgement. However, we can guarantee that sufficient
  resources will be available to accommodate the overhead of any
  earthly programming language or runtime system.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 21:00 UTC) We have added an optional flag, <code>-c</code>, 
  to the command line parameters. If supplied, it indicates how many processor
  cores are available. Teams may wish to use this when implementing parallel
  solutions.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 21:00 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: Despite a tweet
  earlier in the day implying that board sizes are bounded by the size of the
  largest currently-posted problem, there is no fixed constraint on board sizes.
  There is also no fixed constraint on unit sizes.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 21:00 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: When
  determining whether all members and the pivot have been moved "to
  locations that they have previously occupied", all members are treated
  identically. For example, rotating the unit shown on the specification
  page 3 times in place constitutes an error.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 21:00 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: Each occurrence of
  a phrase of power&mdash;even if that occurrence overlaps with another occurrence of
  the same phrase of power&mdash;is counted. For example, if "cthulhu cthulhu" is
  a phrase of power, then the sequence of commands "cthulhu cthulhu cthulhu" contains
  two occurrences.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 17:15 UTC) <em>SCORING CLARIFICATION</em>: Be mindful of
  the fact that scores on a problem leaderboard are <em>averages</em> of 
  the scores across all seeds for the problem, and seeds for which no solution
  is submitted score 0 points.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 17:15 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: The question
  of what happens after death is one of the ancient mysteries, to which
  mankind has never found a definitive answer. However, for the purposes
  of this competition, programs that are killed for violating resource
  limits will earn scores of 0 for their runs. The judges may, at their
  discretion, extend resource limits during the judging process;
  especially promising programs that are terminated before reaching
  their full potential may be reincarnated with more resources. </li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 17:15 UTC) <em>SPEC CLARIFICATION</em>: The command
  line parameter "-p" is a phrase of power, as a string. Your program
  should not strip quotation marks from it. Your shell may require you
  to add quotation marks to it, or escape parts of it, when invoking
  your program.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 15:30 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION</em>: The sequence
  of random numbers to be used for unit selection is computed from all
  generator states, <em>including the seed</em>. This is why the example
  starts with 0.</li>

  <li>(2015-08-07 15:15 UTC) AS2H2 have created "Galois Live Test Team" for 
  internal assessment purposes. Its results will not be counted in the final standings.</li>
  
  <li>(2015-08-07 15:15 UTC) It seems that our scoring system was not properly tuned 
    for the primal powers unleashed by certain submissions. We have made appropriate 
    adjustments, and scores for all submissions have been recalculated.</li> 
     
  <li>(2015-08-07 15:15 UTC) <em>RULES CLARIFICATION:</em> A sequence of
  commands that continues after the game ends (the last piece has been
  played, or the starting position of the next piece would be invalid)
  is an <em>error</em>, and results in a score of <em>0 points</em>.</li>
    
  <li>(2015-08-07 15:15 UTC) If you receive an error that "Only GET or HEAD is supported"
    from the submission server, this likely means that your JSON is malformed. Check your 
    capitalization and formatting carefully. While the fundamental forces of the universe 
    are unperturbed by these minor issues, our (maintained by mere mortals) 
    submission system is very sensitive to such.</li>
    
  <li>(2015-08-07 13:00 UTC) If a submitted program requires a platform other than 
    Linux, we will obtain and use it.  We have a
    wide array of systems at our disposal, including those of Microsoft and
    Apple. However, Linux-based submissions will be faster for us to evaluate, so we can
    take less time away from our world-protecting duties. </li>
