<h1>Problem Specification</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2> <p>The purpose of the competition is to write a
program that can play a game. The objective of the game is to score the
most points by <em>locking</em> units into place while invoking
<em>phrases of power</em>.  As input, the program will take a
description of the initial game state.  As output, the program needs to
produce an encoding of a sequence of <em>commands</em>. The result of
the program will be evaluated by executing the commands and computing a
score. </p>

<div class="floating figure">
<img src="icfpc-2015-board_example.png" alt="board example">
<div class="caption">Example board of width 5, height 10.<br>
The colored cells are full.</div>
</div>
<p>The game state has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>board</em>, which is where all the action happens,
<li>the <em>unit</em> that is currently under the program's control, and
<li>the <em>source</em>, which is the sequence of units that will be under
the program's control in the future.
</ul>

<p>The program will control units, one at a time, by issuing them
<em>commands</em>.  Each command is a single symbol selected from a
fixed predefined set.  Each unit is controlled until it becomes
<em>locked</em>. When a unit is locked, the program is awarded points,
the board may get updated, and then it will proceed to control the next
unit from the source. The game ends if one of the following conditions
occurs:</p> 

<ul> 
<li>all units from the source have been locked, or
<li>there is no space on the board to place the next unit, or 
<li>the program issues a command that causes an error. 
</ul> 

<h2>The Board (a.k.a., the Honeycomb)</h2>
<p>The game board consists of hexagonal cells arranged in rows,
with the first row numbered 0.  The <em>height</em> of the board specifies
the number of rows on the board.</p>

<p>Each row contains an equal number of cells, specified by the
<em>width</em> of the board.  The cells in a row are oriented so that
they have vertices up and down, and edges to the left and right.
The first cell in a row is numbered 0, thus each cell may be
identified by a pair of coordinates <em>(column, row)</em>.
</p>

<p>When we use geographic directions we take "north" to mean "up", or
towards smaller row numbers, and "west" to mean "left", or towards smaller
column numbers in a row.</p>

<p>Odd-numbered rows are displaced to the right, so that the north-west
edge of each cell is adjacent to the south-east edge of the
correspondingly numbered cell in the previous row.</p>

<p>Each cell on the board is either <em>full</em> or <em>empty</em>. 
Each board specifies an initial set of cells that are full.  These
initial board configurations may contain useful information to
contestants.</p>

<h2>Units</h2>
<div class="floating figure"><img src="icfpc-2015-example_shapes.png" alt="example shapes">
<div class="caption">Example units.<br> The pivot is marked by a dot.</div>
</div>
<p>A unit is a non-empty collection of cells that are manipulated together,
and a <em>pivot point</em> used for some commands.
A unit is in a <em>valid location</em> if all of its cells are on empty
board cells. Note that a unit's pivot point need not be on a board cell. 
</p>

<p>When a new unit is spawned (i.e., it emerges from the ether and comes 
under player control), it appears centered at the top of the board.  More 
precisely:</p>

<ul>
<li>the unit appears in its original orientation, as specified in the unit list;
<li>the unit's top-most members are in row 0;
<li>the unit is centered, so that its left-most and right-most members are
equidistant from the left and right sides of the board, respectively.
If the distance to the sides is not a whole number, then round
toward the left (i.e., there will be less space on the left).
</ul>

<p>If the spawn location is not a valid location for this unit, the game ends.</p>


<h2>Unit Commands</h2>

<p>Each unit supports the following commands (as abstract syntax):</p>
<dl>
<dt><code><b>move</b> [ <b>E</b> | <b>W</b> | <b>SE</b> | <b>SW</b> ]</code>
</dt>
<dd>Move all members of the unit one cell in the given direction.</dd>
<dt><code><b>turn</b> [ <b>clockwise</b> | <b>counter-clockwise</b> ]</code></dt>
<dd>Rotate all members of the unit by 60 degrees in the specified direction,
around the unit's pivot point.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Issuing a command that would result in an invalid placement for the
unit <em>locks</em> the unit in place without any movement. The members
of a locked unit become part of the board, and the corresponding cells
on the board become full.  Locking units into place is one way to score
points.</p>

<p><em>Important:</em> the same unit cannot visit a location more than
once.  <i>(The Old Ones do not take kindly to stuttering
computations!)</i>  Issuing a command that would move all members and
the pivot to locations that they have previously occupied is
an <em>error</em>, and the program will score <em>0 points</em> for
that board.</p>

<h2>Updating the Board</h2>

<p>When a unit becomes locked, the board is updated as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>the members of the unit are added to the board, making the corresponding
cells full;
<li>if all cells in a row became full, then the row is <em>cleared</em>; and
<li>if any units remain in the source, the next unit is spawned; otherwise, the game ends.
</ol>

<p>When a row is cleared all of its cells become empty.  Also, the cells from
all rows above (i.e., with smaller numbers) are moved one row down.  Note that
this means that the cells in a row will move either to the SE or SW,
depending on the row number.</p>

<h2 id="phrases">Phrases of Power</h2>

<p>There are <em>eighteen</em> phrases of power that can be invoked
within a sequence of commands. Phrases of power are case insensitive
(the fundamental forces of the universe are unperturbed by minor issues
like capitalization). Points are earned for invoking and repeating these
phrases, as described below.</p>

<p>The shortest phrase of power is the three character phrase
"<em>Ei!</em>". The longest phrase of power is of length fifty-one.
The phrases of power can be found in contest artifacts, tweets, and
background literature and media.</p>

<p>The "Power" columns on the leaderboards indicate how many distinct
phrases of power were invoked in a team's solution to a particular
problem, or over all a team's solutions.</p>

<h2 id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>The player scores points for each locked unit.  There are three factors
that contribute to the number of points that are won:
<ul>
<li>the number of cells in the unit, <em>size</em>,
<li>the number of lines cleared with the current unit, <em>ls</em>,
<li>the number of lines cleared with the previous
  unit, <em>ls_old</em>,
</ul>

<p>The points are computed according to this formula:</p>
<pre>
move_score = points + line_bonus
  <b>where</b>
  points = size + 100 * (1 + ls) * ls / 2
  line_bonus  = <b>if</b> ls_old > 1
                <b>then</b> floor ((ls_old - 1) * points / 10)
                <b>else</b> 0
</pre>

<p>The sum of move scores for all locked units is denoted <em>move_scores</em>.</p>

<p>The player also scores points for invoking phrases of
   power.  For each phrase of power <em>p</em>, there
   are two factors that contribute to the number of points scored:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li>the length of the phrase of power, <em>len<sub>p</sub></em>; and
     <li>the number of times the phrase of power appears in the
       sequence of commands, <em>reps<sub>p</sub></em>.</li>
   </ul>

<p>The score for a phrase of power <em>p</em> is computed according to
this formula:</p>

<pre>
  power_score<sub>p</sub> = 2 * len<sub>p</sub> * reps<sub>p</sub> + power_bonus<sub>p</sub>
  <b>where</b>
  power_bonus<sub>p</sub> = <b>if</b> reps<sub>p</sub> > 0
                 <b>then</b> 300
                 <b>else</b> 0
</pre>

<p>The sum of power scores for all phrases of power is
denoted <em>power_scores</em>.</p>

<p>Consequently, the total number of points earned for a board is:</p>
<pre>
  points = move_scores + power_scores
</pre>

<p>As previously mentioned, issuing a command that would result in an error 
immediately ends the game and the player receives <em>0 points</em> for that board.
</p>

<h1>Formats</h1>

<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>Programs will be given <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> objects
describing the game configurations
and information on how many games to play using the following JSON schema
(names that are in bold correspond to objects described in subsequent sections):

<pre class="figure">
{ "id": number              <span class="comment">/* A unique number identifying the problem */</span>

, "units": [ <em>Unit</em> ]
  <span class="comment">/* The various unit configurations that may appear in this game.
     There might be multiple entries for the same unit.
     When a unit is spawned, it will start off in the orientation
     specified in this field. */</span>

, "width":  number          <span class="comment">/* The number of cells in a row */</span>

, "height": number          <span class="comment">/* The number of rows on the board */</span>

, "filled": [ <em>Cell</em> ]        <span class="comment">/* Which cells start filled */</span>

, "sourceLength": number    <span class="comment">/* How many units in the source */</span>

, "sourceSeeds": [ number ] <span class="comment">/* How to generate the source and
                               how many games to play */</span>
}
</pre> 

<p>For each such JSON object, the program should play one game for each
<em>seed</em> in the field <code>sourceSeeds</code>.  Each of these
games will be scored separately, and will be played using the same
units, board configuration, and number of units. However, the order of
the units will differ depending on the seed.  Full details on how to
order the units in the source are <a href="#the_source">below</a>.</p>

<h3>Cell</h3>
Identifies a cell, either on the board or within a unit.
<pre class="figure">
{ "x": number, "y": number } <span class="comment">/* x: column, y: row */</span>
</pre>

<h3>Unit</h3> 

The configuration of a unit.  The cells are relative to a local
coordinate system, and will be translated to the board when the unit is
spawned. The local coordinate system of each cell, like the board's
coordinate system, has smaller row numbers in the "up" direction and
smaller column numbers in the "left" direction.

<pre class="figure">
{ "members":  [ <em>Cell</em> ]  <span class="comment">/* The unit members. */</span>
, "pivot":   <em>Cell</em>       <span class="comment">/* The rotation point of the unit. */</span>
}
</pre>
Note that the pivot cell does not have to be a member of the unit.

<h3 id="the_source">The Source</h3>
<p>The order of the units in the source will be determined using a
pseudo-random sequence of numbers, starting with a given <em>seed</em>.
The unit identified by a random number is obtained by indexing
(starting from 0) into the field <code>units</code>, after computing
the modulo of the number and the length of field <code>units</code>.
So, for example, if the configuration contains 5 units,
then the number 0 will refer to the first unit, while the number 7
will refer the 3rd one (because <code>7 mod 5</code> is 2, which
refers to the 3<sup>rd</sup> element).</p>

<p>The pseudo-random sequence of numbers will be computed from a given
seed using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear
congruential generator</a> with the following parameters:</p>
<table class="figure">
<tr><td>modulus:</td><td>2<sup>32</sup></td></tr>
<tr><td>multiplier:</td><td>1103515245</td></tr>
<tr><td>increment:</td><td>12345</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The random number associated with a seed consists of bits 30..16 of that seed,
where bit 0 is the least significant bit.
For example, here are the first 10 outputs for the sequence
starting with seed 17:
<code>0,24107,16552,12125,9427,13152,21440,3383,6873,16117</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="flags">Command Line Parameters</h3>
<p>Submissions should support the following command line parameters, which
may be provided in any order:
<table id="params" class="figure">
<tr><th>Flag</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>-f</code></td>
    <td><code>FILENAME</code></td><td>File containing JSON encoded input</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>-t</code></td><td><code>NUMBER</code></td>
    <td>Time limit, in seconds, to produce output</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>-m</code></td><td><code>NUMBER</code></td>
    <td>Memory limit, in megabytes, to produce output</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>-c</code></td><td><code>NUMBER</code></td>
    <td>Number of processor cores available</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>-p</code></td><td><code>STRING</code></td>
    <td>Phrase of power</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The parameter <code>-f</code> may be provided multiple times, which means
that the program should produce results for all of the given inputs.
</p>

<p> If provided, the parameter <code>-t</code> indicates the execution
time to produce the output for <em>all problems</em>. If it has not
finished, the program will be killed after that many seconds. If
<code>-t</code> is not provided, no time limit is imposed on the
program. </p>

<p> If provided, the parameter <code>-m</code> indicates the maximum
amount of memory that the program is allowed to use at any time.
Programs that try to allocate more than this amount of memory will be
killed. If <code>-m</code> is not provided, no memory limit  (other than
the hard memory limit of the system the judges choose to run it on) is
imposed on the program.</p>

<p> If provided, the parameter <code>-c</code> indicates the number of
processor cores available to the program.</p>

<p> If provided, the parameter <code>-p</code> is a phrase of power (for
example, <em>Ei!</em> for the phrase given <a
href="#phrases">above</a>). The parameter <code>-p</code> may be
provided multiple times, once for each phrase of power the program
should attempt to invoke in its output. As you discover more phrases of
power, you can re-run the program with additional <code>-p</code>
command line options; during judging (except for the lightning
division), the program will be passed all the phrases of power.</p>

<h2 id="output">Output</h2>

<p>The output of the program should be a JSON list, containing one entry per problem and seed, using the following
schema:</p>

<pre class="figure">
[ { "problemId": number   <span class="comment">/* The `id` of the game configuration */</span>
  , "seed":      number   <span class="comment">/* The seed for the particular game */</span>
  , "tag":       string   <span class="comment">/* A tag for this solution. */</span>
  , "solution":  <em>Commands</em>
  }
]
</pre>

<p>The <code>tag</code> field is meant to allow teams to associate
scores on the leaderboards with specific submitted solutions. If no
<code>tag</code> field is supplied, a tag will be generated from the
submission time.</p>

<!-- <p>This format may be used to time.</p> -->


<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
<p>For each game played, the program should compute a sequence of commands.
The sequence of commands should be represented as a JSON string, where
each character corresponds to a command, using the following encoding:</p>

<table class="figure">
<tr><td>{p, ', !, ., 0, 3}</td><td><code>move W</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>{b, c, e, f, y, 2}</td><td><code>move E</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>{a, g, h, i, j, 4}</td><td><code>move SW</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>{l, m, n, o, <em>space</em>, 5}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><code>move SE</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>{d, q, r, v, z, 1}</td><td><code>rotate clockwise</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>{k, s, t, u, w, x}</td><td><code>rotate counter-clockwise</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>\t, \n, \r</td><td>(ignored)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Exactly one character from each set is used to denote the
corresponding command; the sets are comma-separated, and no command is
denoted by a comma character. For example, the character sequences
 "2xjw 4s" and "cthulhu" both correspond to the command sequences <code>move
E</code>, <code>rotate counter-clockwise</code>, <code>move SW</code>,
<code>rotate counter-clockwise</code>, <code>move SE</code>, <code>move
SW</code>, <code>rotate counter-clockwise</code>. </p>

<p>(<em>Note:</em> to clarify possibly-ambiguous font rendering, the
letter "l" is a command for <code>move SE</code>, while the number "1"
is a command for <code>rotate clockwise</code>)</p>

<p>The multiple possible choices for each command enable the embedding
of <em>phrases of power</em> (described <a href="#phrases">above</a>)
into command sequences to earn additional points (and help keep the
flesh-eating darkness at bay).</p>

<p>The three white-space characters listed in the table may appear in
the command sequence and will be ignored.  Any symbol in the command
sequence that is not listed in the table will be treated as an
<em>error</em>, and the program will be awarded <em>0 points</em> for
this particular execution. </p>

<h1>Tournament</h1>

<p>Program evaluation will be done in two phases: the
<em>qualifiers</em> and the <em>finals</em>. The qualifiers, which are
additionally split into the <em>lightning division</em> and the
<em>qualifying division</em>, will happen live during the programming
contest. The finals will be conducted by the judges after the
contest ends.</p>

<p>During the qualifiers, teams will submit solutions to a collection of
known problems.  Based on their submissions, teams will be ranked, and
the top-ranking teams will enter the finals.  The number of teams to
enter the finals will be determined by the judges.</p>

<p>The finals will be conducted after the contest, and will determine
the winners. The judges will build the finalists' programs and present
them with a collection of problems that may be different from those used
during the qualifiers.  The resulting solutions will be ranked, and this
ranking will determine the overall winners of the contest.</p>

<h2>The Qualifiers</h2>

<p>The qualifiers will determine the teams that will enter the finals.</p>

<h3>Individual Problem Ranking</h3> 

<p>During the contest, teams will have an opportunity to submit
solutions to the <a href="icfpc-2015-problems.html">qualifier problems</a>.  Each
qualifier problem has its own leaderboard, where teams are ranked
based on the solutions they have submitted for that problem. The score
for a team is the average score of the <em>latest</em> submitted
solutions for each seed of the problem, rounded down to the closest
integer. So, for individual problems, <em>bigger scores</em> are
better.  Seeds without solutions, or that result in errors, score 0
points. In the event of a tie score, the team whose solution invokes
more distinct phrases of power receives the higher ranking. Teams that
tie with respect to both score and number of distinct phrases of power
invoked receive the same ranking.</p>

<h3>Overall Qualifier Ranking</h3>

<p>The overall leaderboard will determine the finalists. The overall
score for a team is the sum of their <em>rankings</em> for the
individual problems.  So, on the overall leaderboard, <em>smaller
scores</em> are better.</p>

<h3>Lightning Division</h3>

<p>The lightning division includes all solutions <em>for which source
code is submitted</em> during the first 24 hours of the contest. Scoring
in the lightning division includes only move-related points, and phrases
of power are not considered. That is, scoring for the lightning division
is exactly as described <a href="#scoring">above</a> except that the
final formula is <code>points = move_scores</code> instead of
<code>points = move_scores + power_scores</code>. Rankings for the
lightning division are determined without the phrases of power
tiebreaker; in the lightning division, all teams with the same score on
the same problem receive the same ranking for that problem. In the
unlikely event of an overall tie in the lightning division, the earliest
of the tied submissions wins.</p>

<p>There is no separate leaderboard for the lightning division.
Lightning division submissions are also qualifying division submissions,
and they appear on the leaderboard accordingly.</p>

<h2>The Finals</h2>

<p>The teams that have the highest overall rank during the qualifiers
will enter the finals. The programs of these teams will be evaluated
by the judges on another set of problems.</p>

<h2>Submitting Solutions</h2>

<p>Before submitting solutions, at least one competitor on a team must
obtain an API token from the login server (<a
href="https://davar.icfpcontest.org/">davar.icfpcontest.org</a>). The
team must also be created on the login server. It is not possible to join 
an existing team using the login server; instead, <em>one</em> team member 
should create the team and add the email addresses of all the other team 
members.</p>

<p>Solutions are submitted using an HTTP <code>POST</code> to the
submission server. One way to accomplish this is to invoke
<code>curl</code>, as follows:</p>

<pre>
    curl --user :$API_TOKEN -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d $OUTPUT \
        https://davar.icfpcontest.org/teams/$TEAM_ID/solutions
</pre>

The variables referenced in the <code>curl</code> invocation are the following:

<table class="figure">

<tr><td><code>API_TOKEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></td><td>The API
token obtained from the login server. It must be prefixed with a colon,
as shown in the command above.</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>OUTPUT</code></td><td>The output of the program (a JSON list, as 
described <a href="#output">above</a>).</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>TEAM_ID</td><td>The numeric team ID of the team submitting the 
solution.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>The URL in the <code>curl</code> invocation is the same as the
submission URL provided in the web interface.</p>

<h2>Submitting Source Code</h2> 

<p>All teams should <a href="https://davar.icfpcontest.org/">submit their
source code</a>. The judges may build and evaluate the source code
further&mdash;in particular, the judges will use it to evaluate the
finalists, to determine the Judges' Prize, and to determine the winner
of the lightning division.</p>

<p>The source code should be submitted as a single <code>.tar.gz</code> file
that should containing at least the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>Makefile</code> to be used by the GNU <code>make</code> utility.
<li>A text file called <code>README</code>.
</ul>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> will be used the build the program.  The
program should build by just executing <code>make</code>.  The result
should be an executable file called <code>play_icfp2015</code>, which
will be used to compute solutions.  This executable should support
the required <a href="#flags">command line parameters</a>.

<p>The <code>README</code> should describe what you'd like the judges to
know about your program&mdash;anything you can write here that will help
the judges build the program and appreciate its cleverness would be
appreciated! In particular, you may want to list the dependencies of
your program, in case it fails to build in the judges' build
environment.  The judges will try to install additional dependencies,
within reason. </p>

<p>When the judges choose to build a program, the build will be done
on a standard Linux system running a recent Ubuntu flavor, with a
standard set of development tools, plus any additional compilers or
interpreters that might be needed. If the build requires a platform
other than Linux, we will obtain and use it.  We have at our disposal
and expertise a wide array of systems, including those of Microsoft
and Apple. </p>

<h2>System Integrity</h2>

<p>OGA takes the integrity of our systems very seriously. Any attempts
to compromise the integrity of the submission server or any other
contest infrastructure will result in disqualification (and more...
<em>serious</em> penalties).</p>
